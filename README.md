This repository hosts an analytics service prototype built with NestJS. The service is intended to ingest millions of user-generated events (clicks, pageviews, transactions) per minute, process and aggregate them, and expose analytics via APIs and dashboards.

The initial setup lives inside the `analytics-service` directory. To get started:

```bash
cd analytics-service
yarn install
yarn start:dev
```
